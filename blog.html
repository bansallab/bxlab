     <h4>Taking advantage of healthcare data to improve influenza surveillance</h4>
          <h5>By Elizabeth Lee</h5>
          <h5>March 20, 2018</h5>
     <p>Every flu season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recruits roughly 3,000 physicians across the United States to report how many of their patients appear to have flu-like symptoms. These physicians form the core of the country&#8217;s sentinel surveillance system, a data source which is used to determine the geographic spread, timing, and severity of the influenza season nation-wide. While everyone acknowledges the importance of sentinel reporting, physicians are given few incentives to participate due to limited time and resources.Â <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006020">My newest paper, which was recently published in PLoS Computational Biology</a>, tackles the challenging question of how to improve targeting for sentinel physician recruitment by leveraging the high volume of aggregated medical claims data.</p>

     <h6>How can we improve sentinel site recruitment?</h6>

     <p>Compared to traditional sentinel surveillance, our medical claims data has reports from over 120,000 physicians and represents roughly 20% of all visits to health care providers during our study period. We found that our estimates of influenza disease burden and our inference about what drives the variation in its spatial distribution were most robust when the same sentinel locations reported data every year. Yet even with the best sentinel recruitment design, we observed that 10-30% of county-level estimates of disease burden were poor at the level of coverage at which the CDC collects U.S. outpatient influenza surveillance data. This means that surveillance practitioners should strive to recruit the same health care providers each flu season in order to get the most information out of the reported data.</p>

     <h6>What did we learn about influenza epidemiology?</h6>

     <p>The statistical surveillance model that we used to evaluate sentinel surveillance design also provided valuable insights about influenza epidemiology in the United States. During our study period of flu seasons from 2002-2003 through 2008-2009, we found that mid-Atlantic states had greater relative risk for influenza disease burden, and that socio-environmental factors, local population interactions, state-level health policies, and sampling and reporting levels contributed to the spatial patterns of disease.</p>
