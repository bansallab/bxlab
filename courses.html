    <h3>Modeling Biological Populations</h3>
    <h4>BIOL 422/522: Spring 2014, 2015, 2017</h4>

    <p>Population biology is a quantitative science dealing with changes in the
    size and composition of populations, and population biologists often use
    mathematical models to infer population dynamics. These models use
    information about the properties of individuals and basic assumptions
    about their interactions to predict population size, gene frequency, and
    optimal behavior strategies of individuals, forming an important
    conceptual framework. This course shows what kinds of insight mathematical
    techniques can give about biological populations of individuals,
    communities, and cells, with applications to animal conservation, disease
    epidemiology and drug treatments.</p>

    <h3>Linked: Exploring Social and Life Sciences</h3>
    <h4>BIOL 044/COSC 044: Fall 2015</h4>

    <p>This interdisciplinary course focuses on the emerging science of complex
    networks and their applications. The material includes the mathematics and
    computer science of networks, their applications to biology, sociology,
    business, transportation, and other fields, and their use in the research
    of real complex man-made and natural systems. Students learn what networks
    are, characteristics that are used to define different types of networks,
    and methods for analyzing networks. Students will have the opportunity to
    apply their knowledge to the analysis of real world networks using an
    interactive storytelling environment (iPython notebook) that integrates
    Python programming code execution with text, math, and visual analytics
    into a single web-based document. This is an <a

    <h3>Influenza: Science and Policy</h3>
    <h4>BIOL 421/521: Spring 2012</h4>

    <p>Influenza, an RNA virus that causes respiratory infections, has been on
    the forefront of global health discourse over the last decade. This
    seminar course explores interdisciplinary topics of influenza virology,
    vaccinology, evolution, epidemiology, and policy through lectures led by
    experts and discussions by contemporary literature. </p>
