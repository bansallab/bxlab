      <p>We focus on the interactions that occur between hosts for the
      transmission of infection.</p>

      <p>These interactions are often difficult to observe, and yet they are key
      drivers in both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections
      disease.</p>

      <p>We use both bottom up approaches (including contact/behavioral data
      collection, transmission experiments, and mechanistic models) and top down
      approaches (including epidemiological data and statistical models) to get
      at important host interactions and the role they plan in dynamics for a
      variety of human, wildlife, and livestock disease systems.
