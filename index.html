<p><b>Our goal is to understand how social behavior and spatial dynamics shape infectious disease transmission and how knowledge of such processes can improve disease surveillance and control in a variety of human and animal disease systems.</b></p>
<p>We combine mathematical models with empirical data to generate insights on mechanisms. We use both bottom up approaches (mechanistic models) and top down approaches (statistical models) alongside observational, experimental and opportunistic data sources.</p>
      <p>We are based in the <a href="http://biology.georgetown.edu">Department of Biology</a> at <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu">Georgetown University</a> in Washington DC.
