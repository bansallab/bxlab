      <p>We focus on the interactions that occur between hosts for the
      transmission of infection. Examples include handshakes among humans, 
      burrow sharing among tortoises, or synchronous breathing among dolphins.
      These interactions are often difficult to observe, and yet they are key
      drivers in both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections
      disease.</p>
      
      <p><b>Our goal is to understand how social behavior shapes infectious disease 
        transmission and how knowledge of such processes can improve disease surveillance
        and control</b></p>

      <p>We use both bottom up approaches (including contact/behavioral data
      collection, transmission experiments, and mechanistic models) and top down
      approaches (using epidemiological data and statistical models) to get
      at important social behavior and the role it plays in dynamics for a
      variety of human, wildlife, and livestock disease systems.
