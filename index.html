    <p>We focus on the interactions that occur between hosts for the
    transmission of infection.</p>

    <p>These interactions are often difficult to observe, and yet they are key
    drivers in both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections
    disease.</p>

    <p>We use both bottom up approaches (including contact/behavioral data
    collection, transmission experiments, and mechanistic models) and top down
    approaches (including epidemiological data and statistical models) to get
    at important host interactions and the role they plan in dynamics for a
    variety of human, wildlife, and livestock disease systems.
