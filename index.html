<p>We focus on the social interactions that that facilitate infectious disease transmission between hosts. Examples include handshakes among humans, burrow sharing among tortoises, and synchronous breathing among dolphins. These interactions are often difficult to observe, and yet they are key drivers of both ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases.</p>
      
<p><b>Our goal is to understand how social behavior and population structure shape infectious disease transmission and how knowledge of such processes can improve disease surveillance and control.</b></p>
      
<p>We use both bottom up approaches (including behavioral data collection, transmission experiments, and mechanistic models) and top down approaches (using epidemiological data and statistical models) to get at important social behavior and its interaction with disease dynamics for a variety of human, wildlife, and livestock disease systems.</p>
