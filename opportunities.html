    <h2>Graduate</h2>
    <p>We recruit students interested in pursuing graduate work in disease ecology
    and network epidemiology for the following programs:</p>  

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://biology.georgetown.edu/graduate/">PhD in Biology</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://gid.georgetown.edu/">PhD in Global Infectious Diseases</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/gpp/partner/gu">GU-NIH PhD in Biomedical Sciences</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h6 class="bolder">How to apply</h6>
    
    <p>Please consult the individual program websites for information on application
    requirements and deadlines.</p>
    
    <p>It is highly recommended that you contact Shweta Bansal to discuss a match between your interest and the lab's before applying to one of these
    programs. Please share your CV/resume and why you think the lab might be the right place for you. If you're comfortable sharing information about your personal background/identity, please do-- we aim to be a diverse community.</p>

    <h6 class="bolder">Are we the right match in terms of research?</h6>
    There are some broad things to know about our work:
    <ul>
    <li>We are an interdisciplinary group so diverse academic backgrounds are welcome!
    <li>All of our work is mathematical/stastical in nature, so past exposure to mathematical modeling or statistical approaches is important (so you can know what you're committing to before signing up for 5 years of work!). This can be in the form of research experience or past course(s). (If you don't have this exposure, but are still interested, get in touch with Shweta for a conversation about other opportunities.)</li>
    <li>For our human disease work, we primarily have funding for work on directly-transmitted diseases and focused on the US public health system as a case study.
