  <h1>Research</h1>

  <p>Our research is based in disease ecology (also known as ecological
  epidemiology). This includes population and community level stuides of the
  interactions between hosts and their pathogens, and covers diseases of both
  humans and animals. In particular, we focus on spatial and temporal
  heterogeneity in transmission, due to variation in host-dependent parameters
  (e.g contact patterns, age, or compliance with public health
  recommendations). We use and develop a variety of mathemtical and
  statistical modeling tools to answer our questions, in particular tools of
  network science.</p>
